# This script will add the public key to the authorized_keys file
# on the remote server. This will allow you to ssh into the remote
# server without a password.

# The script will also create a new ssh key if one does not exist
# already. This is useful if you are running this script on a new
# machine and do not have an ssh key yet.

# The script will also copy the public key to the clipboard. This
# is useful if you are running this script on a remote server and
# do not have access to the clipboard.

# The script will also print the public key to the terminal. This
# is useful if you are running this script on a remote server and
# do not have access to the clipboard.
